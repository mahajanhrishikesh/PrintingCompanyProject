# Printing Job management system
A resource and order management web application which incorporates best-fit algorithms for making the paper use more efficient.

 ### Objective: 
 Consider an order of of 10x10 feet being done on a paper of size 15x15. A lot of area in this case is left blank and wasted. To increase the utility, we can use the remainder for other orders that require the same paper. To preform this task more efficiently, we used knapsack algorithms to efficiently fit the orders on the paper and created a web page that allows the managers to add and manage the orders.
<br>
The site can allow:
- Adding new orders
- Aproving orders from other branches
- Removing orders already submitted
- Getting a preview of how the orders are fitted
- Add and remove papers available for the orders.
